        <h1>Terms and Conditions</h1>
        <p id="date">Last Updated: 02 August 2022</p>
        <p>

      </div>
      <div>
        <h2>B. Account Terms</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong> Required Information</strong>
            <br />
            You must provide a valid email address, password & user name in
            order to complete the signup process. Any other information
            requested is optional, unless you are accepting these terms on
            behalf of a legal entity (in which case we need more information
            about the legal entity) or if you opt for a paid account, in which
            case additional information will be necessary for billing purposes.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong> Account Requirements</strong>
            <br />
            We have a few simple rules for accounts on DataSYNC's Service.
            <br />
            <br />
            <ul>
              <li>
                You must be a human to create an account. Accounts registered by
                "bots" or other automated methods are not permitted. We do
                permit machine accounts:
              </li>
              <li>
                A machine account is an account set up by an individual human
                who accepts the Terms on behalf of the account, provides a valid
                email address, and is responsible for its actions. A machine
                account is used exclusively for performing automated tasks.
                Multiple users may direct the actions of a machine account, but
                the owner of the account is ultimately responsible for the
                machine's actions. You may maintain no more than one free
                machine account in addition to your free personal account.
              </li>
              <li>
                One person or legal entity may maintain no more than one free
                account (if you choose to control a machine account as well,
                that's fine, but it can only be used for running a machine).
              </li>
              <li>
                You must be age 13 or older. DataSync does not target our
                Service to children under 13, and we do not permit any Users
                under 13 on our Service. If we learn of any User under the age
                of 13, we will terminate that User’s account immediately. If you
                are a resident of a country outside the United States, your
                country’s minimum age may be older; in such a case, you are
                responsible for complying with your country’s laws.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <strong> User Account Security</strong>
            <br />
            You are responsible for keeping your account secure while you use
            our Service. <br />
            <br />
            <ul>
              <li>
                You are responsible for all content posted and activity that
                occurs under your account.
              </li>
              <li>
                You are responsible for maintaining the security of your account
                and password. DataSync cannot and will not be liable for any
                loss or damage from your failure to comply with this security
                obligation.
              </li>
              <li>
                You will promptly notify Datasync if you become aware of any
                unauthorized use of, or access to, our Service through your
                account, including any unauthorized use of your password or
                account.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>

            <strong> Conduct Restrictions </strong><br />
            While using DataSync, you agree that you will not under any
            circumstances: <br /><br />
            <ul>
              <li>
                harass, abuse, threaten, or incite violence towards any
                individual or group, including DataSync employees, officers, and
                agents, or other DataSync Users;
              </li>
              <li>
                use our servers for any form of excessive automated bulk

                unsolicited advertising or solicitation through our servers,
                such as get-rich-quick schemes;
              </li>
              <li>
                attempt to disrupt or tamper with DataSync's servers in ways

                DataSync's Service in ways that exceed your authorization;
              </li>
              <li>
                impersonate any person or entity, including any of our employees
                or representatives, including through false association with
                Diffchecker, or by fraudulently misrepresenting your identity or

          </li>
          <li>
            <strong> Scraping </strong><br />
            Scraping refers to extracting data from our Website via an automated
            process, such as a bot or webcrawler. <br /><br />
            <ul>
              <li>
                Researchers may scrape public, non-personal information from
                DataSync for research purposes, only if any publications
                resulting from that research are open access.
              </li>
              <li>
                Archivists may scrape DataSync for public data for archival
                purposes.
              </li>
              <li>
                You may not scrape DataSync for spamming purposes, including for
                the purposes of selling DataSync users' personal information,
                such as to recruiters, headhunters, and job boards. If you
                scrape our site too aggressively we will block your IP. All use
                of DataSYNC data gathered through scraping must comply with the
                DataSync Privacy Policy.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>

            <strong> Privacy </strong><br />
            Misuse of DataSync Users' Personal Information is prohibited.
            <br /><br />
            Any person, entity, or service collecting data from DataSync must
            comply with the DataSync Privacy Policy, particularly in regards to
            the collection of our Users' Personal Information (as defined in the
            DataSyncPrivacy Policy). If you collect any DataSync User's Personal
            Information from DataSync, you agree that you will only use the
            Personal Information you gather for the purpose for which our User
            has authorized it. You agree that you will reasonably secure any
            Personal Information you have gathered from DataSync, and you will
            respond promptly to complaints, removal requests, and "do not
            contact" requests from DataSync or DataSync Users.

          <br />
          <li>
            <strong> Excessive Bandwidth Use</strong> <br />
            If we determine your bandwidth usage to be significantly excessive
            in relation to other DataSync customers, we reserve the right to
            suspend your account or throttle your file hosting until you can
            reduce your bandwidth consumption.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong> User Protection </strong><br />
            You agree not to engage in activity that significantly harms our
            Users. We will resolve disputes in favor of protecting our Users as
            a whole.

        D. User-Generated Content
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong> Responsibility for User-Generated Content</strong> <br />
            You may create or upload User-Generated Content while using the
            Service. You are solely responsible for the content of, and for any
            harm resulting from, any User-Generated Content that you post,
            upload, link to or otherwise make available via the Service,
            regardless of the form of that Content. We are not responsible for
            any public display or misuse of your User-Generated Content.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong> DataSYNC May Remove Content</strong> <br />
            We do not pre-screen User-Generated Content, but we have the right
            (though not the obligation) to refuse or remove any User-Generated
            Content that, in our sole discretion, violates any DataSYNC terms or
            policies.

            <br />
            You retain ownership of and responsibility for Content you create or
            own ("Your Content"). If you're posting anything you did not create
            yourself or do not own the rights to, you agree that you are
            responsible for any Content you post; that you will only submit
            Content that you have the right to post; and that you will fully
            comply with any third party licenses relating to Content you post.

          <li>
            <strong> License Grant to Us </strong><br />
            We need the legal right to do things like host Your Content, publish
            it, and share it. You grant us and our legal successors the right to
            store, parse, and display Your Content, and make incidental copies
            as necessary to render the Website and provide the Service. This
            includes the right to do things like copy it to our database and
            make backups; show it to you and other users; parse it into a search
            index or otherwise analyze it on our servers; share it with other
            users; and perform it, in case Your Content is something like music
            or video.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong> License Grant to Other Users</strong> <br />
            Any User-Generated Content you post publicly may be viewed by
            others. By setting your diffs to be viewed publicly, you agree to
            allow others to view your diffs . If you set your diffs to be viewed
            publicly, you grant each User of DataSync a nonexclusive, worldwide
            license to use, display, and perform Your Content through the
            DataSync Service and to reproduce Your Content solely on DataSync as
            permitted through DataSync's functionality (for example, through
            cloning).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong> Moral Rights </strong><br />
            You retain all moral rights to Your Content that you upload,
            publish, or submit to any part of the Service, including the rights
            of integrity and attribution. However, you waive these rights and
            agree not to assert them against us, to enable us to reasonably
            exercise the rights granted in Section D.4, but not otherwise.
            <br /><br />
            To the extent this agreement is not enforceable by applicable law,
            you grant DataSync the rights we need to use Your Content without
            attribution and to make reasonable adaptations of Your Content as
            necessary to render the Website and provide the Service.
