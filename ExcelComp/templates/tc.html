  </div>
  <div class="tcdiv">
    <h2>B. Account Terms</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong> Required Information</strong>
        <br />
        You must provide a valid email address, password & user name in order to
        complete the signup process. Any other information requested is
        optional, unless you are accepting these terms on behalf of a legal
        entity (in which case we need more information about the legal entity)
        or if you opt for a paid account, in which case additional information
        will be necessary for billing purposes.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong> Account Requirements</strong>
        <br />
        We have a few simple rules for accounts on DataSYNC's Service.
        <br />
        <br />
        <ul>
          <li>
            You must be a human to create an account. Accounts registered by
            "bots" or other automated methods are not permitted. We do permit
            machine accounts:
          </li>
          <li>
            A machine account is an account set up by an individual human who
            accepts the Terms on behalf of the account, provides a valid email
            address, and is responsible for its actions. A machine account is
            used exclusively for performing automated tasks. Multiple users may
            direct the actions of a machine account, but the owner of the
            account is ultimately responsible for the machine's actions. You may
            maintain no more than one free machine account in addition to your
            free personal account.
          </li>
          <li>
            One person or legal entity may maintain no more than one free
            account (if you choose to control a machine account as well, that's
            fine, but it can only be used for running a machine).
          </li>
          <li>
            You must be age 13 or older. DataSync does not target our Service to
            children under 13, and we do not permit any Users under 13 on our
            Service. If we learn of any User under the age of 13, we will
            terminate that User’s account immediately. If you are a resident of
            a country outside the United States, your country’s minimum age may
            be older; in such a case, you are responsible for complying with
            your country’s laws.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        <strong> User Account Security</strong>
        <br />
        You are responsible for keeping your account secure while you use our
        Service. <br />
        <br />
        <ul>
          <li>
            You are responsible for all content posted and activity that occurs
            under your account.
          </li>
          <li>
            You are responsible for maintaining the security of your account and
            password. DataSync cannot and will not be liable for any loss or
            damage from your failure to comply with this security obligation.
          </li>
          <li>
            You will promptly notify Datasync if you become aware of any
            unauthorized use of, or access to, our Service through your account,
            including any unauthorized use of your password or account.

        <strong> Scraping </strong><br />
        Scraping refers to extracting data from our Website via an automated
        process, such as a bot or webcrawler. <br /><br />
        <ul>
          <li>
            Researchers may scrape public, non-personal information from
            DataSync for research purposes, only if any publications resulting
            from that research are open access.
          </li>
          <li>
            Archivists may scrape DataSync for public data for archival
            purposes.
          </li>
          <li>
            You may not scrape DataSync for spamming purposes, including for the
            purposes of selling DataSync users' personal information, such as to
            recruiters, headhunters, and job boards. If you scrape our site too
            aggressively we will block your IP. All use of DataSYNC data
            gathered through scraping must comply with the DataSync Privacy
            Policy.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>

        <br /><br />

        with the DataSync Privacy Policy, particularly in regards to the
        collection of our Users' Personal Information (as defined in the
        DataSyncPrivacy Policy). If you collect any DataSync User's Personal
        Information from DataSync, you agree that you will only use the Personal
        Information you gather for the purpose for which our User has authorized
        it. You agree that you will reasonably secure any Personal Information
        you have gathered from DataSync, and you will respond promptly to
        complaints, removal requests, and "do not contact" requests from

      </li>
      <br />
      <li>

        bandwidth consumption.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong> User Protection </strong><br />

    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong> Responsibility for User-Generated Content</strong> <br />
        You may create or upload User-Generated Content while using the Service.
        You are solely responsible for the content of, and for any harm
        resulting from, any User-Generated Content that you post, upload, link
        to or otherwise make available via the Service, regardless of the form
        of that Content. We are not responsible for any public display or misuse
        of your User-Generated Content.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong> DataSYNC May Remove Content</strong> <br />
        We do not pre-screen User-Generated Content, but we have the right
        (though not the obligation) to refuse or remove any User-Generated
        Content that, in our sole discretion, violates any DataSYNC terms or
        policies.

        You retain ownership of and responsibility for Content you create or own
        ("Your Content"). If you're posting anything you did not create yourself
        or do not own the rights to, you agree that you are responsible for any
        Content you post; that you will only submit Content that you have the
        right to post; and that you will fully comply with any third party
        licenses relating to Content you post.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong> License Grant to Us </strong><br />
        We need the legal right to do things like host Your Content, publish it,
        and share it. You grant us and our legal successors the right to store,
        parse, and display Your Content, and make incidental copies as necessary
        to render the Website and provide the Service. This includes the right
        to do things like copy it to our database and make backups; show it to
        you and other users; parse it into a search index or otherwise analyze
        it on our servers; share it with other users; and perform it, in case
        Your Content is something like music or video.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong> License Grant to Other Users</strong> <br />
        Any User-Generated Content you post publicly may be viewed by others. By
        setting your diffs to be viewed publicly, you agree to allow others to
        view your diffs . If you set your diffs to be viewed publicly, you grant
        each User of DataSync a nonexclusive, worldwide license to use, display,
        and perform Your Content through the DataSync Service and to reproduce
        Your Content solely on DataSync as permitted through DataSync's
        functionality (for example, through cloning).
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong> Moral Rights </strong><br />
        You retain all moral rights to Your Content that you upload, publish, or
        submit to any part of the Service, including the rights of integrity and
        attribution. However, you waive these rights and agree not to assert
        them against us, to enable us to reasonably exercise the rights granted
        in Section D.4, but not otherwise.
        <br /><br />
        To the extent this agreement is not enforceable by applicable law, you
        grant DataSync the rights we need to use Your Content without
        attribution and to make reasonable adaptations of Your Content as
        necessary to render the Website and provide the Service.
