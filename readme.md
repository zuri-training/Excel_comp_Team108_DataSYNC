## PROJECT TITLE

**DATASYNC (spreadsheet compare solution.)**

### BACKGROUND OF THE PROJECT

Spreadsheets are excellent tools for computing data and processing information. Existing ones like Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, Smartsheet, etc. can perform from simple tasks, like basic arithmetic, to hard tasks like visual basic applications (VBA) codes..
However, in instances where two or more worksheets, particularly ones with large amounts of
data, locating specific information like duplicates and differences can be difficult, even for the
best eye. Although existing Spreadsheet packages can detect such errors, theyâ€™ll require
formulas and low codes always, plus, users will still have to scrutinise the output themselves.
It's a laborious process that does too little to increase productivity.

**DESCRIPTION**

In an age where we are increasingly relying on technology to boost productivity, being able to spot duplicates and find other specific Information in a large pool of data within spreadsheets, at the tap of a single button becomes a necessity. A tool like this gives data and information professionals a great advantage, and competitive edge.
Which is where our solution comes in.
Please say hello to **DATASYNC**.
